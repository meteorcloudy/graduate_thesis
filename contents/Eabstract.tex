Due to hybridization events in evolution, studying two different genes of a set of species may yield two related but different phylogenetic trees for the same set of species. In this case, biologists want to measure the dissimilarity of the two trees. The rooted subtree prune and regraft distance has been used for this purpose, and many algorithms and software tools have been developed for computing the rSPR distance of two given phylogenetic trees. Computing rSPR distance has been proven to be NP hard. The previously fastest fixed-parameter algorithm for rSPR distance runs in time $O(2.35^kn)$, where $k$ is the rSPR distance between the two given trees $T_1$ and $T_2$, $n$ is the number of leaves in $T_1$(or $T_2$). In this paper, we present a relatively simpler but faster fixed-parameter algorithm for rSPR distance which runs in time $O(2.27^kn)$.
